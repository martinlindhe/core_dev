<div class="body">

    <p>If you've ever programmed in <a class="external" href="http://www.php.net/" title="External link: PHP
    Prehypertext Processor">PHP</a>, you've probably come across the
    <a class="external" href="http://www.php.net/date" title="External link: date method synopsis"><code>
    date</code></a> method, and maybe thought it was really neat.
    I certainly have, and since formatting and otherwise
    working with date strings in JavaScript isn't
    exactly easy (a lot of <code>getSomeUnit</code>), I thought I'd implement
    a generic solution once and for all, similar to the PHP one.</p>

    <p>This is a pure client-side solution, and because of that, you can't
    always be sure it'll work correctly. Time and date issues are some
    of the <a class="external" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Eppk/js/introdate.html" title="External link: Peter Paul Kochs JavaScript date section">more
    complex</a> matters in JavaScript.
    <a class="external" href="http://www.dannyg.com/" title="External link: JavaScript guru, and much more">
    Danny Goodman</a>'s article,
    <a class="external" href="http://developer.netscape.com/viewsource/goodman_dateobject.html">
    JavaScript Date Object Techniques</a> is hideously old
    (Netscape 3!), but still
    provides a valuable first look at date programming and it's pitfalls.
    Most important of all, <strong>this script in no way helps you determine
    a time, and set it</strong>. All this does, is, when given a <code>Date</code>
    object (where the date is always set), is to print
    it out, in a easier way, compared to what JavaScript usually allows.</p>


    <p>Always test your script, to ensure
    it works in whatever browser you need it to work in. If you're using this code
    for sensitive code, where accurate dating is required, you are out of
    your mind. Use this for cosmetic features and otherwise non-critical code.</p>

    <p class="note">Over the years I've gotten alot of feedback on this code,
    such as bug fixes and improvements. I've tried to update the JavaScript
    file to contain all contributors, but if you are not listed, my apologies.
    </p>

    <h2>How it works</h2>

    <p>Using this function is very simple. You start by downloading, and
    linking the JavaScript file <a href="http://www.svendtofte.com/code/date_format/formatDate.js">formatDate.js</a>.
    You then need to create a date, that you want to format. Let's start
    of simple, and just format what time it is right now:</p>

<pre>d = new Date();
alert(d.formatDate("h:i A")); // shows "01:52 am", or something
                              // similar depending on current time</pre>

    <p>All the various codes you can use, are listed in a table below,
    and they all depend on whatever date the date object has. So,
    if we want to create a specific date:</p>


<pre>// notice that month and date are zero indexed (1st is 0)
d = new Date(1999, 11, 30);   // millenium new years eve
alert(d.formatDate("F dS"));  // shows "December 31st"</pre>

    <p>If you want a letter, not to be interpreted as a code, but instead
    as the mere letter, and you don't want to muck around with
    string building, you can simply escape it. But instead of normal
    escaping (using a single <code>\</code>),
    you need to escape here with two slashes <code>\\</code>.
    Like the letter <code>F</code>, is usually a code, for the month
    name (January, etc), if you instead just want "F", you just go:
    <code>\\F</code>.</p>

<pre>d = new Date(1999,11,30);   // millennium new years eve

// shows "31st of December, the year 1999"
alert(d.formatDate("dS of F, \\t\\he \\ye\\a\\r Y"));  </pre>

    <p>Notice, how you you only need to escape those letters, that are actual
    codes. Therefore, the letters <code>o,f</code> and <code>e</code>
    doesn't need escaping.</p>

    <p>For the full lowdown on how to set dates on <code>Date</code> objects I
    refer to the <a class="external" href="http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.5/reference/date.html">
    JavaScript 1.5 documentation on the <code>Date</code> object</a>.</p>

    <h3>What is supported, and what isn't</h3>

    <p>Most of PHP's date method's switches are supported. Are few aren't.</p>

    <p>Here is a full list of supported switches, unsupported ones, and
    ones, that I might include in the future. The switches are compared against PHP 5.1.3.</p>

    <table class="tufteDesign">
    <tbody><tr>
        <td>Supported switches</td>
        <td>Unsupported switches</td>
        <td>Currently unsupported, but might be included in the future</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="lastrow">
        <td>a, A, B, c, d, D, F, g, G, h, H, i, I (uppercase i), j, l (lowecase L),
            L, m, M, n, N, O, P, r, s, S, t, U, w, W, y, Y, z, Z</td>
        <td>T, e, o</td>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    </tbody></table>

    <h2>Notes</h2>

    <p>The script was written, with emphasis on compatibility. Thankfully,
    the <code>Date</code> object is part of Core JavaScript and
    is thus standardized in
    <a class="external" href="http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/ECMA-262.HTM" title="External link: Standard ECMA-262 : ECMAScript Language Specification">ECMAScript</a>
    3rd edition. Only methods, which are in that specification have been
    used. ECMAScript 3rd edition corresponds roughly to
    <a class="external" href="http://devedge.netscape.com/library/manuals/2000/javascript/1.5/reference/" title="External link: Core JavaScript 1.5 Reference">JavaScript 1.5</a>, and to
    <a class="external" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/script56/html/js56jsoriJScript.asp" title="External link: I couldn't find 5.5, so here's 5.6, very similar">JScript 5.5</a>.
    So that should cover the major newer browsers.</p>

    <p>Nonetheless, older browsers might stumble a bit at places,
    especially problems with timezone offsets, and such things
    is hairy stuff, that one shouldn't really try and fix.
    For more on dates, and how browsers deal with it, Peter-Paul Koch, has
    <a class="external" href="http://www.xs4all.nl/%7Eppk/js/index.html?/%7Eppk/js/introdate.html" title="External link: PPK's Date section">a lot of good stuff on it</a>.</p>

    <p>You can pretty much count on the basic stuff, like getting days,
    date and year. What you might abstain from relying on (at least
    not without testing first), is things such as timezone offsets,
    and other similar switches.</p>

    <h3>Browser support</h3>

    <p>The following browsers have been tested with the script, and
    found to work as expect. If there's any problems, these have been
    noted. If you know any of these to be wrong, or a browser,
    where something fails, <a href="mailto:svendtofte@svendtofte.com" title="Email me">please email me</a>, and tell me.</p>

    <h3>How to localize a script</h3>

    <p>One of the major strengths of a this script, over
    <a class="external" href="http://www.php.net/date">PHP's date function</a>, is
    that PHP's <code>date</code> function can only
    spit out English, this one can be easily modified, to
    spew out other languages, instead of English. And not
    just from English, into, say a Danish script, but
    it will be capable of both things at once. So if a user
    with English set as his language, comes in, he will get
    June, as well, "June", but a Dane will get it as "Juni" (Danish for June).</p>

    <p>In the following section, I'll show how to make the script
    show Danish and English weekdays, instead of only English. The
    technique can be easily applied to all the other words just
    as easily (months, day suffix, and so forth).</p>

    <p>In the top of the <a href="http://www.svendtofte.com/code/date_format/formatDate.js" title="formatDate.js">script</a>,
    you will find this array entry:</p>

<pre>var daysLong = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];</pre>

    <p>Of course, we could just change that into Danish, and we'd
    be fine, but then there'd be no English of course. The solution
    is instead, to create two arrays, and rename them, so they
    show their language.</p>

<pre>var daysLong_en = ["Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday",
                   "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday"];

var daysLong_dk = ["Søndag", "Mandag", "Tirsdag", "Onsdag",
                   "Torsdag", "Fredag", "Lørdag"];</pre>

    <p>And we now need to change the function, which goes into that
    array, so that, before getting the weekday, it checks for language
    the user has set.</p>

    <p>Your options for seeing what language a user has set are
    pretty limited and browser specific I'm afraid. Netscape
    has traditionally (since version 4, Mozilla supports this one too)
    supported the <code>navigator.language</code>
    attribute, while Internet Explorer, also since version 4, has supported
    <code>navigator.browserLanguage</code>. Opera supports both these (
    though I do not know from what version).</p>

    <p>You also need to write an array, with "supported" languages, so
    that in case the language could be detected, but it's not one that
    you've written text for, it'll just go back to English again.</p>

<pre>var supportedLang = ["en", "dk"]; // for our little example,
                                  // danish and english is it</pre>

    <p>The function that finds the week day is the following (the syntax may seem curious to you, but trust me, it works)</p>

<pre>"l" : function () {
    // A full textual representation of the day of the week
    return daysLong[self.getDay()];
}</pre>

    <p>Which can then be rewritten into:</p>

<pre>"l" : function () {
    var lang = "en"; // we default to english
    if (navigator) {
        if (navigator.language) {
            // netscape/mozilla
            lang = navigator.language;
        } else if (navigator.browserLanguage) {
            // internet explorer
            lang = navigator.browserLanguage;
        }
    }

    // if language isn't supported
    if (!supportedLang.exists(en)) lang = "en";

    var a = eval("daysLong_" + lang);
    return a[self.getDay()];
}</pre>

    <p>Of course, you can do the usual
    browser checking stuff, so you don't have to
    write that whole thing over and over. I'll leave it up to the reader,
    to make the script as small as possible :)</p>

    <h3>Test table</h3>

    <p>Here is a table, of how your browser handles the script. Use
    this table, to load up the various browser you want to check,
    and see if they work as expected.</p>

    <p>The date used, is April 16, 1981, at 01:30 after midnight, that's my
    birthday, and the second date used is whatever it's right now.
    Of course, there's no "expected output" from the "now" time.
    If you're wondering why all the timezone stuff doesn't
    have a "expected", it's because the script always runs in YOUR
    timezone, and as such, that will show whatever timezone offset you
    currently have with UTC.</p>

    <p>For a truly exercising test page, I've made <a href="http://www.svendtofte.com/code/date_format/php_random_test.php">a
    huge table</a>, that tests all switches. It randomly generates dates,
    and you can then compare PHP's results, to the one generated by this script.
    Keep in mind, that results printed by my script will be localized,
    that is, numbers changed to fit your timezone. This is most clear in
    the switch <code>r</code> and in the <code>I</code> switch. In the case of <code>I</code>
however, the PHP version will often be wrong, since it works of
whatever the server believes. The script version will work off the
JavaScript date algorithms (which may or not be localized). Still, if
there's anything that isn't doing what I hope it's doing. Please <a href="mailto:svendtofte@svendtofte.com">let me know what
    I'm doing</a> (wrong).</p>
